        <h1>We are gamers. <span>Just like you.</span></h1>
        <p>
          This is our little saying. It’s not really a mission statement but it
          is our mission to make sure that we don’t lose sight of that. We know
          how life can be chaotic and how gaming can serve as a refuge and
          escape for many people. We know how, as we get older and older, the
          time available to play games gets less and less. It sucks.<br /><br />
          We know that. So we strive to make games that bring a little joy to
          your life without being overly complicated. Gone are the days where
          you could pick up almost any game and just have an awesome, fun time.
          Most games these days, to their credit as well, are so immerse and
          have a learning curve that require many hours of study. We want to
          make games that are simple, yet fun. They can have an immersive
          element, but we like to try to keep our games easy-going. As you may
          have guessed, most of the team grew up in the 80’s and early 90’s.
          Anyways, thank you for your interest in DownGround Studios.<br /><br />

          (mostly retro game buying/selling/collecting). Please feel free to
