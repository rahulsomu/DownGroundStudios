        <h1>Retro <span>Collecting</span></h1>
        <p>
          This is a part of our company that is a mix of collecting and retail
          operations. As fans of the 80’s to 90’s gaming era, we are big retro
          game collectors and resellers. Our goal is to both collect different
          systems and games from the past, but also to make them available to
          other collectors.<br /><br />

          We do also collect limited edition, special edition, and other rare
          games and items. As we are in inventory collection mode at the time,
          please stay tuned. Once we have a large enough inventory, we will post
          our collections here.
